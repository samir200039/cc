    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt install default-jre
    sudo apt install default-jdk 

It will take some time to download and install so sit back and wait.
Once itâ€™s done then we have to add the JAVA_HOME to the Ubuntu environment. Run the following in a terminal to open up the /etc/environment file.

      sudo gedit /etc/environment


Now, append the following at the end of the file and save it:

      JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle"

We will set the CLASSPATH in the .bashrc file of the current user so open a terminal and run the following

     sudo gedit /home/vboxuser/.bashrc

Provide the password and add the following lines at the end of the opened file and save it.

        CLASSPATH=".:/home/vboxuser/Desktop/cloudsim-3.0.3/jars/*:
        /home/vboxuser/Desktop/cloudsim-3.0.3/examples"
         export CLASSPATH
         

Now we need to reload the .bashrc file so close the all opened terminals (if any) and run the following

        source ~/.bashrc

Step 3: Testing the Setup (Compiling and Executing a CloudSim Application)

      javac /home/vboxuser/Desktop/cloudsim-3.0.3/examples/org/cloudbus/cloudsim/examples/CloudSimExample1.java
      
  Running the compiled program: The syntax for running a compiled CloudSim program is similar to that of running a program in Java i.e. java filename. In our case we have to type (see image 1)
        java org.cloudbus.cloudsim.examples.CloudSimExample1
